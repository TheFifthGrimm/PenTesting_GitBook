## <mark style="color:blue;">Passive Reconnaissance</mark>

In passive reconnaissance, you rely on publicly available knowledge. It is the knowledge that you can access from publicly available resources without directly engaging with the target. Think of it like you are looking at target territory from afar without stepping foot on that territory.

Three main tools will be covered:

<mark style="color:yellow;">whois</mark> to query WHOIS servers&#x20;

<mark style="color:yellow;">nslookup</mark> to query DNS servers&#x20;

<mark style="color:yellow;">dig</mark> to query DNS servers

We use whois to query WHOIS records, while we use nslookup and dig to query DNS database records. These are all publicly available records and hence do not alert the target.

Two online tools will also be covered

<mark style="color:yellow;">DNSDumpter</mark>

<mark style="color:yellow;">Shodan.io</mark>

These two online services allow us to collect information about our target without directly connecting to it.



#### <mark style="color:red;">Whois</mark>

A request and response protocol that follows the RFC 3912 specification. A WHOIS server listens on TCP port 43 for incoming requests. The domain registrar is responsible for maintaining the WHOIS records for the domain names it is leasing. The WHOIS server replies with various information related to the domain requested.&#x20;

To use the command use the syntax below where DOMAIN\_NAME is the domain about which you are trying to get more information.&#x20;

```
whois DOMAIN_NAME
```



#### <mark style="color:red;">Nslookup</mark>

Use nslookup to find the IP address of a domain name.

```
nslookup DOMAIN_NAME
```

Or, more generally, you can use <mark style="color:yellow;">`nslookup OPTIONS DOMAIN_NAME SERVER`</mark>. These three main parameters are:

<mark style="color:yellow;">OPTIONS</mark> contains the query type as shown in the table below. For instance, you can use A for IPv4 addresses and AAAA for IPv6 addresses.

<mark style="color:yellow;">DOMAIN\_NAME</mark> is the domain name you are looking up.&#x20;

<mark style="color:yellow;">SERVER</mark> is the DNS server that you want to query. You can choose any local or public DNS server to query. Cloudflare offers 1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1, Google offers 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4, and Quad9 offers 9.9.9.9 and 149.112.112.112. There are many more public DNS servers that you can choose from if you want alternatives to your ISP’s DNS servers.

| Query Type | Results            |
| ---------- | ------------------ |
| A          | IPv4 Addresses     |
| AA         | IPv6 Addresses     |
| CNAME      | Canonical Name     |
| MX         | Mail Servers       |
| SOA        | Start of Authority |
| TXT        | TXT Records        |



<mark style="color:red;">**Dig**</mark>

For more advanced DNS queries and additional functionality, you can use dig, the acronym for <mark style="color:yellow;">“Domain Information Groper”</mark>. Let’s use dig to look up the MX records and compare them to nslookup. We can use dig `DOMAIN_NAME`, but to specify the record type, we would use dig `DOMAIN_NAME TYPE`. Optionally, we can select the server we want to query using `dig @SERVER DOMAIN_NAME TYPE`.

<mark style="color:yellow;">SERVER</mark> is the DNS server that you want to query.&#x20;

<mark style="color:yellow;">DOMAIN\_NAME</mark> is the domain name you are looking up.&#x20;

<mark style="color:yellow;">TYPE</mark> contains the DNS record type, as shown in the table provided earlier.

## <mark style="color:blue;">Active Reconnaissance</mark>

Active reconnaissance cannot be achieved so discreetly. It requires direct engagement with the target. Think of it like you check the locks on the doors and windows, among other potential entry points.

Examples of active reconnaissance activities include:

Connecting to one of the company servers such as HTTP, FTP, and SMTP.

Calling the company in an attempt to get information (social engineering).

Entering company premises pretending to be a repairman.
